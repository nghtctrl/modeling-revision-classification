Chew\\*, Jiho Kim\\*\n\n*Equal Contribution","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Introduction\nIn the writing process, effective textual revisions typically result in expansive alterations to the semantic content of a text, as opposed to prescriptive alterations like proofreading; however, novice writers often tend to favor the latter ([Flower et. al 1986](https://doi.org/10.2307/357381)). Therefore, the identification of major semantic alterations in the revisions of student writers could be used to benchmark their progress towards more effective revision. \n\nTo this end, the following report analyzes various applications of language models towards revision evaluation, which is in this case framed as a binary classification task for identifying revisions as “content” (substantive) or “surface” (superficial) revisions. \n\nThis report considers two approaches to the binary classification task.\n\n1. Completion prompting: when given a “fill-in-the-blank” classification prompt like “...the revision is _________”, a language model can implicitly make predictions thanks to the logprobs, or “likelihoods,” it computes for each of the two possible classification terms (“substantive” and “superficial”). Once the model computes these likelihoods, they may be compared with one another to make the classification.\n\n2. Similarity scores: a language model can compute abstract representations (embeddings) of an original and revised text based on their semantic content, and the similarity of those semantic embeddings can be used as a measure of how little a revision changed the “content” of a sentence; these similarities can then be used to predict whether a revision alters a sentence’s semantic meaning significantly enough to be considered a “content” revision.\n\nWithin approach 1, performance on the task improved slightly by preprending contextual information to the prompt, such as example classifications and definitions of the term.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Description of the Dataset\nWe use a dataset called “[ArgRewriteV2](https://argrewrite.cs.pitt.edu/)”, which contains essays written by students in response to a single prompt about the implications of self-driving cars. Each essay has three versions: the original draft, a revision, and a second revision. The second revisions were not made under experimentally constant circumstances, so we will only use the first revisions for our evaluation. \n\nThe dataset contains essay-level, sentence-level, and subsentence-level data. This report only uses the sentence-level data. Our goal is to classify the revision types of revisions using two categories: “superficial” and “substantive.” The “superficial” category corresponds to the revision categories “Word Usage” and “Conventions/Grammar/Spelling” in the dataset. The “substantive” category corresponds to the categories \"Claim/Ideas\", \"Organization\", \"Warrant/Reasoning/Backing\", \"Rebuttal/Reservation\", \"Precision\", \"General Content\", and \"Grammar\" in the dataset. (As opposed to the original dataset’s authors, we placed \"Organization\" in the “substantive” category as an arguably significant change to a sentence.)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Setup","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%pip install sentence_transformers","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-30T18:21:10.913903Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-30T18:21:10.914541Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-30T18:21:23.164882Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-30T18:21:10.914506Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-30T18:21:23.163807Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##### Import Necessary Modules","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, BitsAndBytesConfig\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score, confusion_matrix, roc_curve, ConfusionMatrixDisplay\nimport json\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport pandas as pd\nimport torch\n\ntorch_device = \"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\"\nprint(f\"Using device: {torch_device}\")\n\ntorch.manual_seed(0);","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-30T18:38:19.212132Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-30T18:38:19.213865Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-30T18:38:19.223349Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-30T18:38:19.213826Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-30T18:38:19.222444Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Load Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/argrewrite-v-2-corpus-sentence-pairs/sentence_pairs.csv\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-30T18:21:28.382717Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-30T18:21:28.383232Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-30T18:21:28.423068Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-30T18:21:28.383202Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-30T18:21:28.422219Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"actual_rev_types = []\n\nfor i in range(len(data)):\n    revision_type = data.loc[i, \"revision_type\"]\n    if revision_type != \"neither\":\n        actual_rev_types.append(revision_type)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-30T18:21:28.425605Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-30T18:21:28.425978Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-30T18:21:28.480203Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-30T18:21:28.425935Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-30T18:21:28.47944Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Functions","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##### Get the logprobs for complition given prefix","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def get_completion_logprobs(prefix, completion):\n    with torch.no_grad():\n        completion_ids = tokenizer.encode(completion, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(torch_device)\n        completion_len = completion_ids.shape[1]\n\n        whole_phrase = prefix + completion\n        whole_phrase_ids = tokenizer.encode(whole_phrase, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(torch_device)\n        whole_phrase_logits = model(whole_phrase_ids).logits\n        whole_phrase_logprobs = torch.log_softmax(whole_phrase_logits[0], 1)\n\n        completion_logprobs = []\n        for i in range(-completion_len-1, -1):\n            token_id = whole_phrase_ids[0][i+1]\n            logprob = whole_phrase_logprobs[i][token_id]\n            completion_logprobs.append(logprob)\n\n    return completion_logprobs","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-30T18:21:28.481092Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-30T18:21:28.481325Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-30T18:21:28.487962Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-30T18:21:28.481303Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-30T18:21:28.487132Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##### Function for Plotting ROC Curve","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def plot_roc(actual_rev_types, scores, metric_label):\n    fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(actual_rev_types, scores, pos_label=\"content\")\n    #

Opposed to our expectation, Gemma 2 did not perform as well as GPT-2 in classifying revision types, even though it was a bigger model. We will need to run more experiments to see if the prompt can be generalized across different models.\n\nClassification using cosine similarity is more reliable and interpretable than using the difference of log probs. While the difference of log probs is a common approach, it takes quite complicated steps to calculate and interpret the results. Cosine similarity is more straightforward and easier to understand, as well as performing significantly better in our experiments.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Limitations\n### Dataset Limitations\nThe ArgRewrite corpus only contains essays written for a single argumentative prompt concerning self-driving cars. Thus, the results discussed in this notebook may not fully represent the models’ general classification abilities for essays of other subjects.\n\n### Lack of True Chain-of-Thought Prompting And Computational Limitations\nSuccessful chain-of-thought prompting requires language models to coherently generate intermediate reasoning of some sort to allow them to explicitly condition their final answer on that intermediate generation. More advanced instruction-tuned models are generally required to generate this kind of reasoning with any reliability. To keep this report self-contained, these models were not employed, as their usage would require access to processing power outside that which is freely available on Kaggle. Instead, we prompted GPT-2 with “prepackaged reasoning,” which provided definitional explanations for the completion terms “substantive” and “superficial.” This approach is far less adaptive than chain-of-thought prompting, as it only adds a small amount of boilerplate reasoning to the prompt without adapting to the particulars of the sentences under evaluation. Hence, this report does not provide any workflows to test more advanced models’ chain-of-thought capabilities.\n\n### Using Automation Responsibly\nThis report provides a possible workflow for automatically evaluating students’ revisions, which is not always desirable in every situation. The binary “content”/”surface” categorization lacks nuance and does not provide students with the individual feedback they might need to improve their revision, regardless of writing level. While the quantitative measures used to make the binary classification provide a slightly more nuanced continuous measure, they nonetheless reduce the complex process of revision to a single number that offers little direction for improvement. More complex, personalized feedback is required for students to grow as writers and revisers. Hence, our evaluation methodology is not intended to be used in educational contexts. It is intended to grant insights into broad patterns of revisions, rather than how to personally improve one’s own writing.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Future Improvements\n### Essay-Level Evaluation\nThis report only analyzes sentence-level revision classification, but could potentially be expanded to generate and analyze essay-level revision scores.\n\n### Prompting Modern LLMs\nModern LLMs are much more “competent generalists” on NLP tasks than any model running in a self-contained Kaggle notebook, so further studies into the effectiveness of the “completion approach” might use the APIs of LLMs like GPT-4 or LLAMA-3 to get a better idea of how the very best models could perform on the classification task. These models more reliably generate intermediate reasoning as well, which would allow for additional experimentation with “chain-of-thought” prompting—possibly by prompting models to identify parts of a revision that would lead them to conclude a revision is “surface-level” or “content-level.”\n\n### Evaluating Performance on Revision Subcategories\nThe dataset of revisions used in this report included finer-grained revision categories not considered in our analysis. Our evaluation could benefit from additional, finer-grained analysis of the revision subclasses our models fail at most. With this information in mind, the models could be fine-tuned in an attempt to improve the their performance on those specific subclasses. This report does not use fine-tuning due to time constraints; however, the evaluations provided in this report provide a possible workflow which can be expanded to measure a fine-tuned model’s performance on revision subclasses. Thus, the process of fine-tuning and evaluating performance on revision subclasses will be left to future work.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Appendix","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Wrangling","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import requests\nimport zipfile\nimport io\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport re\nimport warnings","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Download Dataset","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"corpus_url = \"https://argrewrite.cs.pitt.edu/corpus/ArgRewrite.V2.zip\"\ncorpus_path = \"argrewrite-v-2-corpus\"\nresponse = requests.get(corpus_url)\n\nwith zipfile.ZipFile(io.BytesIO(response.content)) as z:\n    z.extractall(corpus_path)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"annotations_path = Path(corpus_path) / \"annotations\"\nxlsx_files = list(annotations_path.glob(\"**/12/*.xlsx\"))\n\nprint(f\"There are {len(xlsx_files)} xlsx files in the corpus.\")","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%pip install -U openpyxl","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def get_ids(prefix, filename):\n    regex = prefix + \"(\\d+)\"\n    return re.search(regex, filename).group(1)\n\n\nold_draft_dfs = []\nnew_draft_dfs = []\n\nfor xlsx_file in xlsx_files:\n    try:\n        with warnings.catch_warnings():\n            warnings.filterwarnings(\n                \"ignore\",\n                category=UserWarning,\n                module=re.escape(\"openpyxl.styles.stylesheet\"),\n            )\n            with open(xlsx_file, \"rb\") as f:\n                old_draft_sheet = pd.read_excel(f, sheet_name=\"Old Draft\")\n                new_draft_sheet = pd.read_excel(f, sheet_name=\"New Draft\")\n\n                writer_id = get_ids(\"Annotation_2018argrewrite_\", str(f))\n\n                old_draft_df = pd.DataFrame(\n                    {\n                        \"writer_id\": writer_id,\n                        \"original_sentence_index\": old_draft_sheet[\"Sentence Index\"].astype(str),\n                        \"revised_sentence_index\": old_draft_sheet[\"Aligned Index\"].astype(str),\n                        \"original_sentence\": old_draft_sheet[\"Sentence Content\"],\n                        \"revision_purpose\": old_draft_sheet[\"Revision Purpose Level 0\"],\n                        \"revision_operation\": old_draft_sheet[\"Revision Operation Level 0\"],\n                    }\n                )\n                old_draft_dfs.append(old_draft_df)\n\n                new_draft_df = pd.DataFrame(\n                    {\n                        \"writer_id\": writer_id,\n                        \"original_sentence_index\": new_draft_sheet[\"Aligned Index\"].astype(str),\n                        \"revised_sentence_index\": new_draft_sheet[\"Sentence Index\"].astype(str),\n                        \"revised_sentence\": new_draft_sheet[\"Sentence Content\"],\n                        \"revision_purpose\": new_draft_sheet[\"Revision Purpose Level 0\"],\n                        \"revision_operation\": new_draft_sheet[\"Revision Operation Level 0\"],\n                    }\n                )\n                new_draft_dfs.append(new_draft_df)\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Error in {xlsx_file}: {e}\")\n\nold_draft_df = pd.concat(old_draft_dfs, ignore_index=True)\nnew_draft_df = pd.concat(new_draft_dfs, ignore_index=True)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(f\"old_draft_df has {old_draft_df.shape[0]} rows.\")\nprint(f\"new_draft_df has {new_draft_df.shape[0]} rows.\")","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Find rows where revision_sentence was indicated to be revised from 2+ original_sentences, indicated by ',' separator\nmultiple_original_indices = new_draft_df[\"original_sentence_index\"].str.contains(\n    \",\", na=False\n)\n\n# Create dataframe storing rows of new_draft_df with sentences revised from 2+ multiple original_sentences\ncombined_sentences_df = new_draft_df.loc[multiple_original_indices]\n\n# Each item in the list will be a string of sentences that were combined in the new_draft_df\ncombined_sentence_strings = []\n\n# For each case where sentences were combined:\nfor row in combined_sentences_df.iloc:\n    writer_id = row[\"writer_id\"]  #
